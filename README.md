# studyassistant
Front-End part of the application that won first place in http://appsforstudents.aftleuven.be/. 
The backend consists of a server that gathers information from different sensors using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The sensors gather
different information of the environment (light, temperature, carbon dioxide levels). The front end shows different charts of this information
and gives an estimation of how suitable is the environment for studying or working.
